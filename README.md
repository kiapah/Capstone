Face Emotion Detection CNN

As this is my first attempt at creating a repository, it may get messy.

This project was developed as a Capstone project for an MIT Data Science Professional Certification.  The project explores the creation and configuration of various deep learning techniques, mainly Convolutional Neural Networks because images of faces are the training materials for the model.

Multiple architectures are explored.  Simplistic CNNs. Transfer learning using VGG16, ResNet, and EffientNet as pre-trained training weights plus my chosen added layers. Deep complex neural networks.

The results varied wildly, but the EfficientNet and one of my complex models performed the best with F1-accuracy scores above 74%.

The dataset is made up of many 48x48 grayscale faces.  Different faces expressing 1 of 4 emotion categories: Happy, Sad, Neutral, Surprised.  

Through supervised learning on these properly labeled images I attempt to train an AI model to accurately predict the emotion expressed by a face.
